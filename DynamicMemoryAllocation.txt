stack memory(small in size - default) used for saving 
    1. local variables
    2. funtion parameters

Heap memory(big in size - default) used for saving
    1. here we use new keyword to create a memory space over there
    2. int * a = new int; here (new int) returns an address that is stored in the pointer
    3. to deallocate the memory used by using new keyword we use another keyword ie delete


the size of the both stack and heap memory can be changed:
    1. compiler settings
    2. os configeration

stack me memory taken apne aap deallocate ho jaati hai
